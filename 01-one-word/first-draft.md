# Irrational

The word "irrational" in english dictionary describes behaviors or thoughts not based on reason or clear thinking. The use of this word is not a big deal, but it becomes problematic when it is unfairly and regularly applied to women.

In many situations, it´s okay to use the term  "irrational" to describe emotions, decisions, or actions that lack reason or clear thinking. However, this word is frequently, and often unfairly, associated with women. This is because of gender biases that have depicted women as too emotional and unpredictable. The fact that women are usually more emotionally intelligent doesn´t mean they are blinded by emotions and don´t think clearly. Since when does emotional equal irrational? 

The word "irrational" really bothers me because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women. Women have always been painted as emotional, moody, and irrational - unlike men who are supposedly rational and level-headed. The use of this word reinforces these stereotypes and unfairly labels them as emotional rather than thoughtful. This actually has real consequences. Women in our society are  not taken seriously - from workplace discrimination to problems in personal lives and societal expectations. It can even have impact on their mental health and can make women feel less than.

The overuse of the word "irrational" to describe women can undermine their credibility. Women's opinions or decisions are often dismissed as irrational and based solely on emotions. It becomes quite challenging for them to be taken seriously. This can interfere with their participation in important decision-making processes. It adds to the idea that women´s thoughts are less valuable or less reliable than those of men - which feels awful. 
 
Women who voice different opinions than men or express strong emotions are often accused of being irrational. This happens even in political discussions where everyone should be equal. It again serves to silence women and discourage them from speaking out. This is a significant barrier to achieving a more inclusive society where women and men are equal.

In conclusion, the word "irrational" itself is not negative, it´s neutral. However, its frequent association with women perpetuates stereotypes and undermines their credibility. Everyone should be aware of the gendered connotations of such terms. This way we can all feel equally important in our society.
