Hey, I'm Mimi, an animation student with a passion for pushing the boundaries of creativity. I find joy in experimenting with various art media, striving to bring imagination to life in every project I undertake.

Outside the realm of animation, you'll often find me in the kitchen, satisfying my love for baking (a delightful escape during moments of procrastination) or tending to my growing collection of house plants. I would love to open my own tattoo studio and a flower shop in one.

I believe in cherishing every special occasion, and I love to bring people together by organizing memorable parties. Whether it's a promotion or a random Tuesday, I find any excuse to celebrate and share joy with those around me.

As I navigate my animation journey, I'm eager to contribute my unique perspective to the industry. Join me on this exciting adventure where creativity knows no bounds, and every project is a canvas for magic. Let's bring stories to life, one frame at a time!
