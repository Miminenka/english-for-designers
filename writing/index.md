# “Irrational”


Since when does emotional equal irrational?  

Imagine saying something you know for a fact is true and men not believing you because you´re a woman. Or even belittling you. But when a guy says the same thing, he´s being praised for it. It´s a terrible feeling...

The word "irrational" in english dictionary describes behaviors or thoughts not based on reason or clear thinking. It´s pretty neutral, right? 

In many situations, it´s okay to use the term "irrational". The use of this word becomes problematic when it is unfairly and regularly applied to women. This is because of gender biases that have depicted women as too emotional. The fact that women are usually more emotional doesn´t mean they can´t think clearly. 

The word "irrational" bothers me because it perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women. Women have always been painted as emotional, moody, and irrational - unlike men who are supposedly rational and level-headed. The use of this word reinforces these stereotypes. It labels women as emotional rather than thoughtful. This actually has real consequences. Women are often not taken seriously - from workplace discrimination to problems in personal and social lives. It can have impact on their mental health and can make women feel less than.

The overuse of the word "irrational" to describe women can undermine their credibility. Women's opinions or decisions are often dismissed as irrational and based on emotions. It can become quite challenging for them to be taken seriously. This can interfere with their participation in important decision-making processes. It adds to the idea that women´s thoughts are less valuable or less reliable than those of men - which feels awful.
 
This is a problem even in political discussions where everyone should be equal. Accusing women of being irrational again serves to silence and discourage them from speaking out. This is a significant barrier to achieving a more inclusive society where women and men are equal.

In conclusion, the word "irrational" itself is not negative, it´s neutral. The problem is its frequent association with women. This perpetuates stereotypes and undermines their credibility. Everyone should be aware of the gendered connotations of words like "irrational". This way we can all feel equal and important.
